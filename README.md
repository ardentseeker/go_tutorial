this repo holdes mupltiple small methods
it is more like my footsteps how i will become good in the Go.
every single method that is present is a learning step and easy to revision too.
we have learnt the usage of map and map as set , added a method to check the existence of a key but we can do that directly too
remember - MAP is also refrence type and hence we cant equate two map m1 == m2 is wrong
struct data type can holds all type of data , but is the better practice to define a struct data type first and then create another element of that data type
